The file /my-dockerized-nodejs-app/my-dockerized-nodejs-app/frontend/public/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf is a font file and typically contains binary data rather than text. Therefore, it cannot be represented as plain text. 

If you need to create this file, you would typically copy it from an existing source or generate it using a font creation tool. 

For the purpose of this response, I will indicate that this file is intentionally left blank as it is a binary file.
